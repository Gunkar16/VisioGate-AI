# VisioGate-AI
VisioGate AI ensures that the barricade opens only for recognized individuals. When a person is identified by the image classification AI on the laptop, the Arduino activates the servo motor to open the barricade, accompanied by a green LED. If a person is not recognized, the barricade remains closed, a red LED activates, and a siren plays. Additionally, a photo of the individual is captured along with the date and time for security records. This intelligent system continuously monitors access, providing robust security for sensitive areas and can be used in server rooms and data centers as well.
